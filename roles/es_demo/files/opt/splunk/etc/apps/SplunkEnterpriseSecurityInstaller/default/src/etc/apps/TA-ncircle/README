	Source type(s): ncircle:ip360
	Has index-time operations: false, this TA does not need to be placed on indexers
	Input requirements: Data must be source typed as 'ncircle:ip360' and the IP360 system must be set up to 
                         forward with the correct format, as described below.
	Supported product(s): nCircle IP360 Vulnerability Scanner

Using this Add-on:
----------------------------------------
	Configuration: Manual
	Ports for automatic configuration: None
	Scripted input setup: Not applicable

	IP360 supports multiple export formats. The device needs to be set up to output the CSV format that contains a scan time. Sample events for this format are as follows:
	
	    Network6,Hostname,255.255.255.255,OS,13938,SMTP Open Mail Relay,25,12/10/2009 6:12,305
	    Network7,Hostname,255.255.255.255,OS,13938,RPC automountd Available,32996,12/10/2009 6:12,0
	
	Note that the other CSV format does not include a scan time.

Mapping nCircle Severities
----------------------------------------
	
	This technology add-on includes a script, generate_ncircle_severities.py,
	which can be used to map nCircle fine-grained severities to severities
	more appropriate for use in the Splunk Apps for Enterprise Security and 
	PCI Compliance. The script will create a lookup table that maps nCircle
	severities by numeric ranges to the following severity values:

		information, low, medium, high, critical
		
	By default, the lookup table is located in:
	
		<TA installation directory>/lookups/ncircle_severities.csv 
	
	To run the script in the Splunk search bar, use the following syntax:
	
		| ncircleseverities -I 0-10 -L 11-20 -M 21-30 -H 31-40 -C 41-53

	To use the script from the CLI (command-line interface), use the following
	syntax:
	
		$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd python ./generate_ncircle_severities.py -I 0-10 -L 11-20 -M 21-30 -H 31-40 -C 41-50
	
	Additional help on the script is available by running the script with the "-h"
	switch:
	
		$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd python ./generate_ncircle_severities.py -h
