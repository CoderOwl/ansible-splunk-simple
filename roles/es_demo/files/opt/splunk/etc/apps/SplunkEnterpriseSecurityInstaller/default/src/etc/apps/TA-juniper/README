    If Juniper data is consumed on an alternate port add the following to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-juniper/local/props.conf
    
		[source::udp:514]
		TRANSFORMS-force_info_for_juniper = 
		
		[source::udp:<port # here>]
		SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
		TRANSFORMS-force_info_for_juniper = force_host_for_netscreen_firewall,force_sourcetype_for_netscreen_firewall,force_sourcetype_for_juniper_nsm,force_sourcetype_for_juniper_nsm_idp,force_sourcetype_for_juniper_sslvpn
