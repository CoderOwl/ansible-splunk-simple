Installing Splunk Engine for deployment

0.  Python Dependency (Universal Forwarder only)
Python is not bundled with Splunk's Universal Forwarder and will need to be installed manually if the forwarder will be running python scripted inputs
(often deployed via Deployment Server).  Also ensure "python" is in your operating system's path.

1A.  Windows Install

Full Splunk (from Administrative Command Prompt):
# msiexec.exe /i Splunk.msi SPLUNK_APP="" RBG_LOGON_INFO_USER_CONTEXT=1 /quiet

	a.  Replace Splunk.msi with correct path and name of package
	b.  SPLUNK_APP="" installs with 0 apps enabled (we are going to deploy our own)
	c.  RBG_LOGON_INFO_USER_CONTEXT=1 installs as Local System user
	d.  /quiet installs silently

Universal Forwarder (from Administrative Command Prompt):
#msiexec.exe /i splunkuniversalforwarder.msi MIGRATESPLUNK=0 AGREETOLICENSE=Yes /quiet

	a.  Replace splunkuniversalforwarder.msi with correct path and name of package
	b.  MIGRATESPLUNK=0 determines whether migration from an existing forwarder will occur during installation. 
		If MIGRATESPLUNK=1, the installer stops the existing forwarder and copies its checkpoint files to the new universal forwarder.
	c.  AGREETOLICENSE=Yes agrees to the EULA. This flag must be set to Yes for a silent installation. 
	d.  /quiet installs silently
	
1B.  Nix Install 

Full Splunk (from Administrative Console):
#cd /opt
#mv /tmp/Splunk.tgz /opt
#tar -xvf Splunk.tgz

	a.  Replace /tmp/Splunk.tgz with correct path and name of package
	
Universal Forwarder (from Administrative Console):
#cd /opt
#mv /tmp/universalforwarder.tgz /opt
#tar -xvf universalforwarder.tgz

	a.  Replace /tmp/universalforwarder.tgz with correct path and name of package
	b.  To migrate an existing Full Splunk installation, YOU MUST PERFORM THE FOLLOWING BEFORE STARTING THE UNIVERSAL FORWARDER for the first time:
		In the universal forwarder's installation directory, $SPLUNK_HOME, create a file named old_splunk.seed; in other words: $SPLUNK_HOME/old_splunk.seed. 
		This file must contain a single line, consisting of the path of the old forwarder's $SPLUNK_HOME directory. For example: /opt/splunk. 
	
	
2.  Enable boot-start
	
	a.  Nix only
	# /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start
	
	
3.  Apply forwarder license (Full Splunk only)

	a.  Windows:
	# copy %SPLUNK_HOME%\etc\splunk-forwarder.license %SPLUNK_HOME%\etc\splunk.license
	
	b.  Nix:
	# cp $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/splunk-forwarder.license $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/splunk.license


4.  Change default password
This command changes the admin password from changeme to foo:
# splunk edit user admin -password foo -role admin -auth admin:changeme


5.  Configure deployment ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/deploymentclient.conf)
See deploymentclient.conf.local
See http://www.splunk.com/base/Documentation/latest/Admin/Deploymentclientconf

	a.  #clientName = <clientName>:
	- Disabled by default
	- A name that can be used to filter on by deployment server, and takes precedence over dns names.

	b.  phoneHomeIntervalInSecs = 86400
	- Enabled by default (once per day)
	- Comment '#' to set phone home interval at default (30 seconds)

	c.  targetUri = <deploymentServerName>:8089
	- Needs configuration by default
	- Replace <deploymentServerName> with address of present or future splunk deployment server
	- Recommend using DNS is possible, such that client's don't need to be reconfigured if you change your deployment server address
