PaloAlto Add-on
----------------------------------------
	Author: Splunk
	Version/Date: 11/30/2012 15:35 pm
	Source type(s): pan
	Input requirements: The data input must be assigned the source type 'pan' or 'pan_log'.
						The actual source types are then set based on message criteria. 
						Note that you will not be able to search for PaloAlto data based
						on a search for 'sourcetype=pan' since this source type is replaced
						with a more specific source type (see below for details).
	Has index-time operations: true, this TA needs to be deployed on indexers
	Supported product(s): Palo Alto Networks

Using this Add-on:
----------------------------------------
	Configuration: Manual
	Ports for automatic configuration: None
	Scripted input setup: Not applicable
	
	This Add-on assigns several source types to Palo-Alto events. Below is a
	list of the source types that will be assigned:
	____________________________________________________________________________________
    | Source Type  | Description                                                       |
    |--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | pan_config   | Events that denote a change in the configuration of a device      |
    | pan_system   | Events regarding the status of the device                         |
    | pan_threat   | Events that denote an attack or intrusion                         |
    | pan_traffic  | Events that denote attempted and successful network communication |
    |______________|___________________________________________________________________|

	Note: A previous version of this TA utilized a colon-separated form for the
	sourcetype, e.g., "pan:config". This TA is compatible with the previous form,
	and should work in installation that have existing indexed data typed with
	the prior naming scheme.
