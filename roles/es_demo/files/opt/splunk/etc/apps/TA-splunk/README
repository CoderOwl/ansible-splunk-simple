	Source type(s): audittrail
	Input requirements: Not applicable. This Add-on handles internal Splunk data that is automatically indexed
	                    and sourcetyped by Splunk and normalizes it for ESS.
	Has index-time operations: false, this TA does not need to be deployed on indexers
	Supported product(s): splunk

Using this Add-on:
----------------------------------------
	Configuration: Automatic
	Ports for automatic configuration: None
	Scripted input setup: Not applicable
	
	Other considerations: This Add-on maps data from indexes that may not be accessible to all users (i.e. _audit).  
	                      This can affect drill down behavior for non-administrative users.  To prevent this data from being
	                      mapped, simply disable eventtypes as needed.  Alternatively, access can be granted to the non-administrative
	                      index for the desired role(s).
