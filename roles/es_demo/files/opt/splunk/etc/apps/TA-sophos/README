	Source type(s): sophos
	Input requirements: Data can be received via WinEventLog:Application or SEC Server logs.
	
	                    WinEventLog:Application:
	                    Data must be imported correctly using Windows-TA (since Sophos logs are stored in Windows events
	                    logs). Once imported, this technology add-on will process the Sophos data.
                      
                      SEC Server Logs:
                      Data can be received via syslog, or by monitoring the SEC Server log .
	                    To receive data over syslog, manually set the source type for the associated data
	                    input to 'sep'. To monitor log files, see the details under "Using this Technology
	                    Add-on" below.

	Has index-time operations: true, this TA needs to be deployed on indexers
	Supported product(s): Sophos

Using this Add-on:
----------------------------------------
	Configuration: Automatic
	Ports for automatic configuration: None
	Scripted input setup: Not applicable

	This Add-on can import data directly by monitoring files on the SEC Server or via syslog. To monitor the files
    directly you'll need to set the log file location in the inputs.conf file and enable the associated file inputs. To do so:

	1. Create the following file:
    
            $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-sophos/local/inputs.conf
        
	2. SEC Server log Example:

            Create a file input monitor
            
            [monitor://<SEC_LOG_PATH>\Threats.log]
            sourcetype = sophos:threats

            SEC Server log sourcetypes:
            - sourcetype = sophos:threats
            - sourcetype = sophos:webdata
            - sourcetype = sophos:firewall
            - sourcetype = sophos:appcontrol
            - sourcetype = sophos:devicecontrol
            - sourcetype = sophos:tamperprotection
            - sourcetype = sophos:datacontrol
            - sourcetype = sophos:computerdata

	3. SEC Server Syslog Stream Example:

            Create a syslog monitor
            
            [udp:514]
            sourcetype=sophos:utm:firewall

            Syslog sourcetypes:
            - sophos:utm:firewall
            - sophos:utm:ips
            - sophos:utm:ipsec
