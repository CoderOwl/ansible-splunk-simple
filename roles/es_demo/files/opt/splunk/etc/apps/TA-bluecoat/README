	Source type(s): bluecoat
	Input requirements: Data needs to be source typed as "bluecoat". The appropriate transform must be enabled if the data is from SGOS 4 (see "Using this Add-on" section below).
	Has index-time operations: true, this TA must be placed on indexers
	Supported product(s): 
          * Bluecoat ProxySG 5 (default)
          * Bluecoat ProxySG 4 (see below for required edits)

Using this Add-on:
----------------------------------------
	Configuration: Manual
	Ports for automatic configuration: None
	Scripted input setup: Not applicable
	
	This Add-on processes data that has been assigned the source type "bluecoat". To use the add-on, configure the data input with the source type “bluecoat” and it will optimize the data automatically.
    
    By default, this Add-on handles SGOS 5 data but NOT SGOS 4 data. To handle SGOS 4 data and NOT SGOS 5 data:

	    1. Copy TA-bluecoat/default/transforms.conf to TA-bluecoat/local/transforms.conf
	    2. Comment out the SGOS 5 transforms by putting a # character in front of the first FIELDS statement in TA-bluecoat/local/transforms.conf.
	    3. Enable the SGOS 4 transforms by removing the # character from the second FIELDS line.
